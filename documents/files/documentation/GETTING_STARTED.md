# Getting started

This document explains how to create a new repository, including a team and a new project.

## Creating a new project

1. Head to [tooling.digitalinnovation.be](https://tooling.digitalinnovation.be), you are greeted with a welcome screen or a login screen. If you are greeted by the login screen, login using GitHub.
1. Click the "Open Tools" button.
1. Select the "Generate scaffolded project" item from the menu.
1. You are now on the start page of this tool.
1. Fill in the academic year. For example: 2022-2023.  
   **Important**: you need to fill in this date according to this format `XX-XXX`. (Notice the `-` in the format)
1. Next, fill in the project code. This code is found in the Excel sheet in Teams and/or Clockify.
1. Next, fill in the project summary. This is the very short, often 2 to 3 word description found in the Excel sheet in Teams and/or Clockify.
1. Next, select a template.  
   **Important**: always select the template unless you are 100% sure that you know what you're doing and you are not violating any guidelines, style guides and/or NDAs. This setting **WILL** change the default access behaviour.
1. Next, select if the repository should be made public or private.  
   **Tip**: Is your project under NDA? Select private. Otherwise public is fine and allows anyone to view the code. This is a good thing to put on your portfolio and encourages you to write clean code.
1. Press the "Next" button.
1. Select all the people that should have access to the repository. (Coaches are always included automatically, you don't have to select them)
1. Press the "Next" button.
1. Review that everything looks normal and correct. If so, press the "Generate scaffolded project" button. The tool will now create all the resources neccessary. At the end it will give you a confirmation.
